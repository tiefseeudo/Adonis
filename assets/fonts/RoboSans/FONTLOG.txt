FONTLOG for the RoboSans fonts

This file provides detailed information on the RoboSans Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the RoboSans fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

RoboSans is derived from NotoSans and Noto Sans CJK. NotoSans CJK
supports Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters. We needed to switch
fonts in order to display certain characters correctly depending on
the currently selected language. Using NotoSans CJK doesnâ€™t have
english characters that have a similar style to our existing font,
but Noto Sans does. Making a single font for all languages to reference
will be consistent and maintainable. Combining NotoSans and NotoSans CJK
gives us a similar look to our current one while being consistent
when supporting other languages. Both NotoSans and NotoSans CJK are
licensed under Open Font License.

RoboSans has two different fonts: RoboSans-Regular and RoboSans-Bold.

RoboSans-Regular uses NotoSans - Semi Condensed, for english and
latin characters, and NotoSans SC - Regular, for simplified chinese
characters.

RoboSans-Bold uses NotoSans - Semi Condensed Bold, for english
and latin characters, and NotoSans SC for simplified chinese characters.
RoboSans will be updated with languages that we will support.
